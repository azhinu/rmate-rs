# rmate â™¥ Rust

fast, reliable implementation of **rmate** in Rust.

Pre-complied binaries for multiple platforms are available in [Releases page](https://github.com/azhinu/rmate-rust/releases).

### Features

- Support all options and rmate.rc settings described in [Ruby implementation](https://github.com/textmate/rmate).
- Create backups of local files to avoid corrupting your files if any io/network operations go wrong.
- Verbose logging of operation (use `-v` one or more times). See [![the screencat](https://asciinema.org/a/fqgvpm9yPdDFAZ11f8uY1DF26.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/fqgvpm9yPdDFAZ11f8uY1DF26).

### Difference with spamwax/rmate-rs

- Create file if given file name does not exist by default
- `--nocreate` flag to avoid file creating

### Changelog:

- 2022.04.06:
  - Inverted `--create` flag
  - Updated `.gitignore`
  - Removed unused CI config
