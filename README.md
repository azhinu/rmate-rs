# rmate â™¥ Rust

fast, reliable implementation of **rmate** in Rust.

Pre-complied binaries for multiple platforms are available in [Releases page](https://github.com/listboss/rmate-rust/releases).

### Features

- Support all options and rmate.rc settings described in [Ruby implementation](https://github.com/textmate/rmate).
- Create backups of local files to avoid corrupting your files if any io/network operations go wrong.
